# My config files for [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org)

## Please note: this repository has been superseded by [Oh my Hammerspoon!](https://github.com/zzamboni/oh-my-hammerspoon) and is out of date

This repository contains my config files for Hammerspoon. This config
has already replaced my use of the following apps:

- [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com) - clipboard history, only
  supports text entries for now. See
  [clipboard.lua](misc/clipboard.lua).
  - `Shift-Cmd-v` shows the clipboard menu.
- [Breakaway](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23361/breakaway) -
  automatically pause/unpause music when headphones are
  unplugged/replugged. Only for Spotify app at the moment, and it
  needs latest Hammerspoon built from source (which includes the audio
  device watcher). See
  [headphones_watcher.lua](audio/headphones_watcher.lua).
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) - window
  manipulation. Only some shortcuts implemented, those that I use, but
  others should be easy to add.  See
  [manipulation.lua](windows/manipulation.lua).
  - `Ctrl-Cmd-left/right/up/down` - resize the current window to the
    corresponding half of the screen.
  - `Ctrl-Alt-left/right/up/down` - resize and move the current window
    to the previous/next horizontal/vertical third of the screen.
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-F` or `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-up` - maximize the current window.
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-left/right` - move the current window to the
    previous/next screen (if more than one monitor is plugged in).
- [ShowyEdge](https://pqrs.org/osx/ShowyEdge/index.html.en) - menu bar
  coloring to indicate the currently selected keyboard layout (again,
  only the indicators I use are implemented, but others are very easy
  to add). See
  [menubar_indicator.lua](keyboard/menubar_indicator.lua).

It additionally provides the following functionality:

- Automatic/manual configuration reloading ([hammerspoon_config_reload.lua](apps/hammerspoon_config_reload.lua))
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-r` - manual reload, or when any `*.lua` file in
    `~/.hammerspoon/` changes.
- A color sampler/picker ([colorpicker.lua](misc/colorpicker.lua))
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-c` toggles a full-screen color picker of the colors in
    `hs.drawing.color` (this is more impressive with a larger list of
    colors, like the one in
    [PR#611](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/pull/611/files)). Clicking
    on any color will copy its name to the clipboard, Cmd-clicking
    copies its RGB code.
- Mouse locator ([mouse/locator.lua](mouse/locator.lua)).
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-d` draws a red circle around the mouse for 3 seconds.
- Skype mute/unmute ([skype_mute.lua](apps/skype_mute.lua))
  - `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-Shift-v` mutes/unmutes Skype, regardless of whether
    it's the frontmost application.

It has drawn inspiration and code from many other places, including:
